KENTUCKY FIREPLACE
A Font by S. John Ross

As with many of my hand-drawn fonts, KENTUCKY FIREPLACE was born for fantasy cartography, while mapping the world of Uresia: Grave of Heaven (look for it if you enjoy fantasy worlds!), but I named it for Kentucky because it was a mellow evening with some bourbon involved.

KENTUCKY FIREPLACE is a full-U.S.-keyboard set with a couple of extras. Enjoy!
