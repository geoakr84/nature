Keyboard Map of SPAchmim, a public domain Coptic font
Created by: Jimmy Adair, Scholars Press

Description: SPAchmim exists in both Macintosh and Windows 
versions, both with the same character and keyboard maps.  By 
design, all characters in the font lie between decimal 32 and 127 
(20x-7Fx, 040-0177), so they should transfer without problem over 
the Internet.  The font is designed to follow the Thesaurus 
Linguae Graecae encoding scheme to as 
great an extent as possible, with extra characters added that are not 
present in Greek (see <a href="http://purl.org/TC/TC-translit.html#Coptic">
http://purl.org/TC/TC-translit.html#Coptic</a>).  In addition to the 
standard Sahidic characters, three 
forms of the Bohairic/Achmimic chai (corresponding to the variant forms 
of the glyph) are included.  The composite character ti and the 
supralinear stroke are also included.  

A few differences may exist among keyboards for some shifted keys 
(e.g., is " shift-' or shift-2 ?), so people with different 
keyboards will have to make the proper adjustments.
